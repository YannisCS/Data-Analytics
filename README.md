# Clustering
## Task 1
Datasets posted with the project (“Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”,
“Data5.csv”) contain the data points and their respective class information. For each of the 5
datasets, follow the steps below:
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters.
2. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation metrics.
3. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the original
class
4. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the class
allocated by each clustering algorithm
## Task 2
The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes. Do the
following tasks using the “WorldIndicators.csv” dataset posted with the project:
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together
2. Use internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the countries
included within the groups
4. Generate 3 different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points according to
the group. (Example: “Life expectancy vs GDP”, “Infant Mortality vs GDP”, etc.)
